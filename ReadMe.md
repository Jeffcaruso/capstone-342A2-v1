### other note
 - Eariler, it seemed like Bazel (Bazelisk) server was down / misconfigured.
 - Now, everything is working, including 342-a1 which didn't have any updated code.
 - So, I still might end up using that new code I found that seems to be faster, simpler for the install of Bazel, but that is explaining what happened...
